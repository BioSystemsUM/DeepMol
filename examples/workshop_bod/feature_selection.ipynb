    "The boruta algorithm works by comparing the importance of each feature in the original dataset with the importance of the same feature in a shuffled version of the dataset. If the importance of the feature in the original dataset is significantly higher than its importance in the shuffled dataset, the feature is deemed \"confirmed\" and is selected for the final feature subset.\n",

    "It iteratively adds and removes features from the confirmed set until all features have been evaluated. The final set of confirmed features is the one that has a statistically significant higher importance in the original dataset compared to the shuffled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of Boruta is that it can capture complex relationships between features and identify interactions that may not be apparent in simpler feature selection methods. It can also handle missing values and noisy data, which can be challenging for other feature selection techniques."
