    "Extracting features from molecules is a common task in machine learning. There are 4 different types of features: 0D, 1D, 2D, 3D, or 4D.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0D features are descriptors that describe the individual parts of the molecule together as a whole, such as the number of atoms, bond counts or the molecular weight.\n",
    "- 1D features are descriptors that describe substructures in the molecule (e.g. molecular fingerprints).\n",
    "- 2D features are descriptors that describe the molecular topology based on the graph representation of the molecules, e.g. the number of rings or the number of rotatable bonds.\n",
    "- 3D features are descriptors geometrical descriptors that describe the molecule as a 3D structure.\n",
    "- 4D features are descriptors that describe the molecule as a 4D structure. A new dimension is added to characterize the interactions between the molecule and the active site of a receptor or the multiple conformational states of the molecule, e.g. the molecular dynamics of the molecule.\n",

    "As we increase the level of information about a molecule (from 0D to 4D), we also increase the computational cost of calculating the features. For example, calculating 3D features requires the generation of 3D conformers, which can be computationally expensive for large molecules. In addition, some features may not be available for certain molecules, e.g. 3D features cannot be calculated for molecules that do not have a 3D structure. Fortunately, DeepMol provides methods for generating compound 3D structures."
