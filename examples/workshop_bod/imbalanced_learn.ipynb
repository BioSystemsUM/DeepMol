    "# Imbalanced Learn with DeepMol\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced data is a common problem in machine learning and deep learning, including in the field of chemoinformatics. Imbalanced data refers to datasets where the number of instances of one class is significantly larger or smaller than the number of instances of other classes. For example, in chemoinformatics, there may be datasets where the number of active compounds is much smaller than the number of inactive compounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imbalanced data can lead to biased and suboptimal models, as traditional machine learning algorithms may not be able to learn the minority class effectively. This is where imbalanced learning techniques, such as those implemented in the imbalanced-learn library, can be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepMol provides various methods for handling imbalanced data, including oversampling, undersampling, and combination methods. These techniques can help to balance the data and improve the performance of the machine learning models, especially in chemoinformatics where imbalanced data is common.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a chemoinformatics dataset where there are many inactive compounds and few active compounds, oversampling techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be used to generate synthetic examples of the minority class, improving the model's ability to learn from the minority class. On the other hand, undersampling techniques can be used to reduce the number of majority class samples, making the dataset more balanced."
